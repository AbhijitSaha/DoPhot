Saha's version of DoPhot 

======

To grab the files use

   git clone git@github.com:AbhijitSaha/DoPhot

Files will got into the DoPhot/ directory.

You can update from the server at any time by typing

       git pull

inside the DoPhot/ directory.

If LaTeX or BiBTeX complain that they can't find mn2e.cls or mn2e.bst,
just copy them into the manuscript directory.  For these files -- or
any other changes specific to your computer -- "git cp" or "git add"
should NOT be used.

To edit collaboratively, you'll need to do a few more things.

1. Create yourself an account on github (free) and tell AbhijitSaha your
   username, so he can add you as a collaborator.

2. Configure git on your machine, adapting the following

       git config --global user.name "Alan M Turing"
       git config --global user.email amt@universal.machine

   This is not essential, but good practice.  It's fine to put your
   real name and email address here -- no spam results.

   This step needs to be done once per person per machine.

3. Set ssh keys so you can communicate securely with the server.
   See https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys

   This step also needs to be done once per person per machine.

4. When you add a new file that you wish to be tracked:

       git add myfile

5. When you want to send your current version to the server:

       git commit -am "short message"
       git push

6. A useful command is

       git status
