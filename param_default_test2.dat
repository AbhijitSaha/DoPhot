=
=  THIS IS THE MASTER DoPHOT DEFAULT PARAMETER FILE AND IT SHOULD NOT BE 
=  DELETED OR MODIFIED!
=
=  DoPHOT Parameter files are pseudo-FITS headers.  Each line must have an 
=  equals sign and at least one blank space immediately before and after it.  
=  Comments may be placed after the parameter value on any line and the equal 
=  sign may be located anywhere on a line.  A maximum of 80 characters is 
=  allowed per line.  Character variables MUST be enclosed in single quotes.  
=  All keyword names must start in the first column.  Normal Fortran naming 
=  conventions are used to identify integer and real variables:  keywords 
=  starting with letters between I and N (inclusive) represent integer 
=  variables, all others are reals except for variables in quotes which are 
=  assumed to be character variables.  No restrictions apply to character 
=  variable keyword names except that all keyword names must be kept to under 
=  20 characters.  Null character variables are represented as a blank space 
=  between single quotes.  To avoid confusion, avoid using two consecutive 
=  single quotes.
=
=  In this master file, the parameters are grouped according to the typical

=
=
=  FREQUENTLY UPDATED PARAMETERS.  These parameters mostly depend on the
